//        LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to ArrayList.
//
//        Reason: LinkedListâ€™s each element maintains two pointers (addresses)
//                which points to the both neighbor elements in the list. Hence
//        removal only requires change in the pointer location in the two neighbor
//        nodes (elements) of the node which is going to be removed. While In ArrayList
//        all the elements need to be shifted to fill out the space created by removed element.
